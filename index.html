      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Mae">

      <p>My name is Mae. I was born in Belleville, NJ and moved to PA roughly 7 years ago. I have two dogs and one cat. I enjoy hiking and taking pictures. I do a lot of yoga. I enjoy traveling. I once got in the car and drove all the way to the Grand Canyon because I wanted to see it. Well worth the road trip! I've only left the country, once, and that was to see Quebec.</p>

      <p>I started graphic design about 10 years ago. I used to play with Gimp when I was bored and one day I realized I could apply what I learned to get a job that wasn't minimum wage work at a deli. I began with freelance work, making no money, but building a portfolio. I was hired by AOS in 2016 as a graphic artist. Since then, my level of knowledge has drastically improved and I design ads that print in weekly newspapers all over the country.</p>

      <p>I like to teach myself everything I want to know. With this method, I've learned how to play guitar, ukulele, and piano. I taught myself how to drive standard, in 4 days, no less! I even taught myself how to change the crankshaft sensor in a 98 Chevy Camaro. That one was rough and took a long time, but in 2 months, I had the engine running. I believe the only thing keeping us from knowing it all is ourselves.</p>
